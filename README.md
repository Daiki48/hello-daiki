# Install

To run this plugin, you need [denops.vim](https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim).  
Check this [doc](https://vim-denops.github.io/denops-documentation/introduction.html) for detailed instructions.

## For example, for [dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) , set it like this.

```
[[plugins]]
repo = 'vim-denops/denops.vim'

[[plugins]]
repo = 'Daiki48/hello-daiki'
```

I don't know about other plugin managers. Sorry.

# used

In the terminal, type the command `nvim`.

```
$ nvim
```

When nvim is in command mode, type `:DenopsDaiki` .

```
:DenopsDaiki
```

The result is `daiki` output.

```
daiki
```

It mimics the helloworld described in this document.
It was the first time in my life that I made a plugin. I made a lot of errors.
